Colonialism

Developed by Jack Delia


Colonialism is a game written in Java that procedurally generates a map and allows players to explore and colonize that map. 
Cities grow and produce resources that can be sold for more money. It is currently still in development.

Maps in Colonialism are procedurally generated.

The player starts with no vision, but then sends out explorers to explore the map
